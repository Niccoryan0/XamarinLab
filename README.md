# Working with Xamarin
*Nicco Ryan, Yasir Mohamud, Peyton Cysewski*

## The Experience
Working on a Xamarin application without formal guidance was another opportunity to learn how to learn. Fortunately for us, the documentation was great. The  next best thing from learning from a teacher is by following a step by step guide that provides examples. To maximize our learning we all tinkered with various guides that demonstrated simpler tasks like adding a slider, styling the view, or manipulating properties. In the short time being exposed to Xamarin we were able to see a lot of similarities to Razor Pages and the MVVM design pattern, but also a lot that was brand new.

## The Outcome
The methods that allow properties are passed around and binded from the front end to the back end were very confusing. We wanted to make a simple "ToDo" list, but a proper one was still rather complex, requiring some light database integration as well. In the end, we settled with a simple test page that has our names on it. When clicked, the background color changes. It makes use of event listeners and property manipulation.

## Takeaways
Xamarin is very flexible, but very deep. Yasir and Nicco are even going to dive deeper and work with it for their final project. Despite working with HTML, XML has enough differences to feel foreign even though it looks very similar. To really dive into Xamarin or to do this again with more time, it would be more beneficial to start with the basics and understanding all the different components such as the layouts and the views. We dove right into this and it's a lot to absorb without the proper foundation.
